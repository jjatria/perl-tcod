=head1 NAME

TCOD::Tileset - Font loading functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TCOD;

    my $tileset = TCOD::Tileset->load_tilesheet(
        dist_file( TCOD => 'arial10x10.png' ),
        32, 8, TCOD::CHARMAP_TCOD,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tilesets encapsulate font loading functions.

Tilesets can be loaded as a whole from tile-sheets or True-Type fonts.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 load_tilesheet

    $tileset = TCOD::Tileset->load_tilesheet( $path, $cols, $rows, $charmap );

Return a new TCOD::Tileset from a simple tilesheet PNG image. The location
of this file in disk is specified in C<$path>.

The values in C<$columns> and C<$rows> is the shape of the tileset. Tiles are
assumed to take up the entire space of the image.

The value in C<$charmap> is the character mapping to use. This is an array
reference of codepoints which map the tiles like this:

    $charmap->[ $tile_index ] = $codepoint

For common tilesets, C<$charmap> should be the value in C<TCOD::CHARMAP_CP437>.

There is no default value. If no value is provided, no tiles will be mapped.
In this case, you'll need to use L<remap|/remap> to assign codepoints to this
tileset.

=head2 load_bdf

    $tileset = TCOD::Tileset->load_bdf( $path );

Return a new TCOD::Tileset from a C<.bdf> file.

For best results, the font should be monospace, cell-based, and single-width.
As an example, a good set of fonts would be the Unicode fonts and tools for the
X11 package.

=head2 tile_shape

    ( $width, $height ) = $tileset->tile_shape;

Returns a list with the width and height of the tile in pixels.

=head2 remap

    $tileset->remap( $x, $y, $codepoint );

Reassign the Unicode codepoint specified in C<$codepoint> to the character
in this tilesheet at the position specified by the C<$x> and C<$y> coordinates.

This is the tile position itself, not the pixel position of the tile.
Large values of C<$x> will wrap to the next row, so using C$x> by itself
is equivalent to C<Tile Index> in the python-tcod L<Character Table Reference|https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcod/charmap-reference.html>.

This is normally used on loaded tilesheets. Other methods of TCOD::Tileset
creation won't have reliable tile indices.
