Revision history for TCOD

{{$NEXT}}

    New:
        - Added bindings for some additional TCOD::Context methods:
          - new_console
          - recommended_console_size
    Fixes:
        - Added missing documentation for TCOD::Context and TCOD::Tileset
          objects.
    Changes:
        - The new_terminal method for TCOD::Context objects has been
          removed. This is a deprecated method that was implemented in
          error. The candle that burns twice as fast burns twice as bright.
        - Some methods for TCOD::Tileset objects that have only been partially
          implemented have been removed until they are ready for prime-time.

    New:
        - Added TCOD::ColorRGBA used internally in some of the
          new API functions
        - Added TCOD::Event to wrap around SDL2 events. This uses
          an internal set of SDL2 bindings, while we wait for a
          stable release on CPAN
        - Added TCOD::Context and TCOD::Tileset modeled after the
          recommended API in the upstream python-tcod
    Fixes:
        - Fixed the walk method for Path::Dijkstra objects. This
          method, and the related is_empty, are now documented and tested.
    Changes:
        - Imported bundled fonts from python-tcod to replace the
          old ones with licensing issues.
        - The TCOD::Console API has been updated to reflect
          upstream deprecated methods.
